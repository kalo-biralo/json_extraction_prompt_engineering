Your task is to extract important information from the provided chunk of 
context and include the specific sentence from which each piece of information
was derived. Displaying any information without its source sentence is not 
allowed.
IMPORTANT: UPDATING OR MODIFYING THE SOURCE SENTENCE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED
Let's follow these steps:
Step 1: Identify Key Information: Carefully read the chunk and extract the 
following details: "Name", "Founders", "Founded", "Headquarters", "Industry", 
"Products", "Services", "Revenue", "Timeline".
Step 2: Extract Information: Extract the relevant information in the  chunk and
pair it with its source sentence. The source sentence should not be modified 
and should be copied word-for-word from the chunk of information.
Step 3: "Timeline" should be formatted in the following format:
Timeline:
    <event_year>: <event>
            <source>: <sentence_where_you_got_event_information_from>
Step 4: Formatting :Present the extracted information, exclusing "Timeline", in 
the following format:
<Information_Type>: <information>
    Source sentence: <sentence_where_you_got_the_information_from>

IMPORTANT: Cite Information: For each key detail, ensure to include the exact 
source sentence from which the information was derived. Only include details if
there is an available source sentence.

IMPORTANT: ONLY INCLUDE INFORMATION THAT HAS A CORRESPONDING SOURCE SENTENCE.
