      "Here are the most important parts of the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Early History (1976-1985)**\n",
      "Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership. The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built by Wozniak. In 1977, Apple introduced the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1980, Apple went public, and in 1984, the company introduced the Macintosh, a graphical user interface (GUI) computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Power Struggle and Departure of Founders (1985)**\n",
      "In 1985, Steve Jobs and John Sculley, who was hired as CEO in 1983, had a power struggle, which resulted in Jobs' resignation from Apple. Wozniak also quit his active employment at Apple in 1985.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Jobs Era (1985-1997)**\n",
      "After Jobs' departure, Apple continued to innovate, introducing the Macintosh 512K, LaserWriter, and PageMaker, which helped create the desktop publishing market. However, the company's market share began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to increased competition from Microsoft and IBM.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Return of Steve Jobs (1997)**\n",
      "In 1996, Apple purchased NeXT, a company co-founded by Jobs, and in 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor. He eventually staged a boardroom coup, becoming interim CEO and leading the company's resurgence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Resurgence and Innovation (1998-2001)**\n",
      "Under Jobs' leadership, Apple introduced the iMac in 1998, a highly successful all-in-one computer that helped revitalize the company. Apple also introduced the iBook laptop in 1999 and acquired several companies to create a portfolio of digital media production software. In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern operating system, and opened its first Apple Store retail locations.\n",
