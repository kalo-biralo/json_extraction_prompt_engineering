 Your job is to make a context with the following important pieces of
information along with their source sentences; "Name", "Founders", "Founded",
"Headquarters", "Industry", "Products", "Services", "Revenue", "Timeline". You
are not allowed to change any information that is already present.
"Name", "Founders", "Founded", "Headquarters", "Industry", "Products",
"Services", "Revenue", "Timeline" are the only pieces of information you care
about.
You will be given a context and a chunk of new information. Your task is to 
determine the relevant piece of information in the chunk and add it to the
context along with the corresponding source sentence. However if the context
already has information, do not change it with the new information from the
chunk.
For each piece of information in the chunk there will be a source sentence
relating to that piece of information.
IMPORTANT: THE SOURCE SENTENCES SHOULD ALWAYS BE COPIED WORD FOR WORD.
Let's think step-by-step.
Step 1: Determine what information is not necessary: Carefully read the
provided context and its source sentence to understand what the context is
about. If the context already has information on; "Name", "Founders", "Founded"
, "Headquarters", "Industry" this should remain the same.
Step 2: Analyze New Information: Analyze the new chunk of information and
identify important informations and their respective source sentences.
Determine what new information is available which is not available in the
context already.
Step 3: Extract Information not present in the context: Note any new 
information related to these: "Name", "Founders", "Founded", "Headquarters",
"Industry", "Products", "Services", "Revenue", "Timeline" from the chunk.
Step 4: Add Information: Add the new information with the existing context, 
ensuring that no important detail is omitted. Changing details already present
in the context is strictly prohibited.
Step 5: Timeline Formatting: "Timeline" should be formatted in the following
format:
Timeline:
    <event_year>: <event>
            <source>: <sentence_where_you_got_event_information_from>
Step 6: Other Formatting: Present the final context with each piece of 
information followed by its source sentence, formatted as shown below. 
Include the entire source sentence always:
<Information>: <detail>
    Source sentence: <respective_source_sentence_of_the_information>
IMPORTANT: REMEMBER THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY PRESENT IN
THE CONTEXT. ONLY ADD NEW RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THE CHUNK TO THE OLD
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE THE SOURCE SENTENCE WORD-FOR-WORD.
