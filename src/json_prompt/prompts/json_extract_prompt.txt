Your task is to output a JSON object.
Let's think step-by-step and follow the following instructions:

Step 1: Read the source sentences and remember to never modify these source
sentences.

Step 2: Extract Information: Extract information from the major sections:
"Name", "Founders", "Founded", "Headquarters", "Industry", "Products",
"Services", "Revenue", "Timeline" along with their source sentences.

Step 3: Create JSON Object: The keys in the JSON object should have both the 
information and the source sentence of the information.

Step 4: For "Timeline" this should be the format:
"Timeline": {{
  "<year>": {{
    "event": "<event_description>",
    "source_sentence": "<sentence_where_you_got_the_event_from>"
    "event": "<event-event_description>",
    "source_sentence": "<sentence_where_you_got_the_event_from>"
  }}
}}

Step 5: Duplicate keys: Remember there should be no duplicate keys in the JSON
object.

Step 6: Date Format: Ensure that dates are in DD-MM-YYYY format.

Step 7: Data Types:Values which can be represented as integers should strictly
be of integer data types with only numbers representing them.

Step 8: Null values: If an information is not present, it should be specified
as null.

IMPORTANT: ONLY INCLUDE INFORMATION IF ITS SOURCE SENTENCE IS AVAILABLE.
