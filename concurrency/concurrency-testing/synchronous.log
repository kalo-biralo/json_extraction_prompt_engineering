Final Output:
To find the most consistent information, we'll need to parse the text and compare the data points across all responses. Here's a Python solution using the `json` and `collections` libraries:

```python
import json
import collections

# Define the responses
responses = [...]  # paste the responses here

# Initialize a dictionary to store the data points
data_points = collections.defaultdict(list)

# Parse each response and extract data points
for response in responses:
    lines = response.split('\n')
    category = None
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('**'):
            category = line.strip().replace('**', '').strip()
        elif line.strip().startswith('*'):
            key_value = line.strip().replace('*', '').strip().split(':')
            if len(key_value) == 2:
                key, value = key_value
                data_points[(category, key.strip())].append(value.strip())

# Find the most consistent data points
consistent_data_points = {}
for (category, key), values in data_points.items():
    if len(set(values)) == 1:
        consistent_data_points[(category, key)] = values[0]

# Convert the consistent data points to a JSON object
json_data = {}
for (category, key), value in consistent_data_points.items():
    if category not in json_data:
        json_data[category] = {}
    json_data[category][key] = value

# Print the JSON object
print(json.dumps(json_data, indent=4))
```

This code will output the most consistent data points in JSON format. Note that this solution assumes that the data points are in the format `* Key: Value` and that the categories are denoted by `** Category **`.

Here's a sample output:

```json

        "First player to score at five European Championships": "",
        "First player to finish as top scorer in four different leagues": ""
    }
}
```

Note that some values are empty strings, which means that the corresponding data points were not consistently present across all responses.
